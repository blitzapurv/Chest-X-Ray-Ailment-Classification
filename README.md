# Chest-X-Ray-Ailment-Classification
Identifying Lung Problem/Ailment from Chest X-ray images.

## Objective
The objective of the present study is to identify images where an "effusion" is present. There are a total of 8 classes, but I have used only two classes - 'effusion' and 'nofinding'. Here, the latter represents a "normal" X-ray image.
This same methodology can be used to spot various other illnesses (other 6 classes) that can be detected via a chest x-ray.
